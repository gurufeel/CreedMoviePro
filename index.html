        <h2>What Makes Creed Your Favorite?</h2>
            <article>
                <p>Creed is an amazing movie with an amazing cast of actors and celeberites which gives it a knockout for success. One of my favorite actors (Michael B. Jordan) is the star of this movie alongside Sylvester Stallone who many people know as "Rocky". This movie is anticipating a sequel this coming fall and the anticipation is felt from many people across the globe. This Movie is a standout not only because it is one of the only boxing movies in a world of overfilled movie releases, but it is from the franchise of "Rocky" which gives it such a overpowering feeling.

        <h2>About?</h2>
            <article>
                <p>As mentioned above this movie is a sequel to the "Rocky" series of movies which takes off with a new character from a familiar background. Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) is Apollo Creeds (Rockys ex opponents) son. Adonis is a very headstrong man who has alot of talent despite being self-taught. This movie has a heavy hip-hop feel which is perfect for the deliverance of the blows and twists and turns this story takes. Throughout the movie the relationship between Rocky and Adonis grows in a way that is perfect for this storyline.</p>
